![](https://github.com/davetang/bioinformatics_tips/actions/workflows/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)

A [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) project for sharing bioinformatics tips. See the [Quick start guide](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/#quick-start) for more information.

Use `script/run_rstudio.sh` to [run RStudio Server with Docker](https://davetang.org/muse/2021/04/24/running-rstudio-server-with-docker/) and use this to edit/build the pages in the `analysis` directory.

The built page is viewable at <https://davetang.github.io/bioinformatics_tips/>.
