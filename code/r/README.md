## README

Use `remotes::install_github` to install packages from GitHub instead of `devtools::install_github`. `remotes` is a light and dedicated package without additional dependencies, whereas `devtools` has a lot of dependencies.

To render the Rmd files, run the following.

```bash
my_rmd=code_folding.Rmd
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('$my_rmd')"
```
