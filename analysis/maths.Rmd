Recall some maths basics from school.

## Exponentials

Product Rule of Exponents

$$
x^2 \times x^5 \times x^{14} = x^{21}
$$

```{r}
x <- 7
x^2 * x^5 * x^14 == x^21
```

Negative exponents are the reciprocal of the positive exponent.

$$
x^-2 = (\frac{1}{x})^2
$$

```{r}
x <- 7
x^-2 == (1/x)^2
```

Multiply exponents.

$$
(x^2)^3 = x^{(2)(3)} = x^6
$$

```{r}
x <- 7
(x^2)^3 == x^6
```

Why is $x^0 = 1$?

The **multiplicative inverse property of algebra** states that any nonzero real number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1.

$$
\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = 1
$$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{x^a}{1} \times \frac{1}{x^a} = 1 \\

x^a \times x^{-a} = 1 \\

x^{a - a} = 1 \\

x^0 = 1
$$
