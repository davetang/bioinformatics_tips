See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were

<p>The Internet has become an integral part of our lives. When
exchanging data over the internet, the data passes through various
networks and devices. There are four problems that can occur when data
is transferred from one party to another:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Interception</li>
<li>Spoofing</li>
<li>Falsification</li>
<li>Repudication</li>
</ol>
<p>These four problems are countered by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Encryption</li>

<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p>Encryption means performing an operation on data such that a computer
cannot decipher into something meaningful, i.e. turn data into
ciphertext. A key is typically used to perform the encryption’s numeric
calculation and the same key is used to decrypt the encrypted data. One
way of achieving this is by using a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher">XOR cipher</a>; XOR
(exclusive or) is an operation that works like OR but returns zero when
both conditions are true.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 XOR 0 = 0</li>
<li>1 XOR 1 = 0</li>
<li>1 XOR 0 = 1</li>
<li>0 XOR 1 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>If our data (in binary) is 00110011 and our key is 11110000 then:</p>
<ul>
<li>data = 00110011</li>
<li>key = 11110000</li>
<li>ciphertext = 11000011</li>
</ul>
<p>If we use the same key on the ciphertext, we obtain the original
data:</p>
<ul>
<li>ciphertext = 11000011</li>
<li>key = 11110000</li>
<li>data = 00110011</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="hash-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Hash functions</h2>
<p>A hash function converts data into a random string of fixed length.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 message-digest
algorithm</a> is a widely used (but outdated) hash function that
produces a 128-bit hash value.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo hello world | md5sum</code></pre>
<pre><code>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4  -</code></pre>
<p>The output is in hexadecimal (0-9 then A-F), which requires 4 bits to
represent because F in hexadecimal is 1111 in binary. Therefore the 32
long hexadecimal number is 32*4 bits. Any data used as input into the
MD5 hash function will return a 128-bit hash value or a length 32
hexadecimal number.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo abc | md5sum</code></pre>
<pre><code>0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1  -</code></pre>
<p>When given the same input, a hash function will invariably produce
the same output.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo hello world | md5sum</code></pre>
<pre><code>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4  -</code></pre>
<p>However, if the input data only differs by a single bit, the output
is very different.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo hell world | md5sum</code></pre>
<pre><code>a3723e12600ef5c0456c201f5e8c7a37  -</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, completely different data can produce identical hash
values but this has a very low probability and is known as a hash
collision. Finally, it is impossible to convert hash values back into
their original data.</p>
</div>
<div id="shared-key-cryptosystem" class="section level2">
<h2>Shared-key cryptosystem</h2>
<p>Shared-key or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">symmetric-key</a>
cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced
Encryption Standard</a> is the first (and only) publicly accessible
cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA).</p>
<p>The problem with shared-key systems is that in order for the
receiving party to decrypt the encrypted file, the key needs to be
transferred as well. A secure method is necessary for transmitting keys,
i.e. performing a key-exchange. There are two types of methods:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Methods using key-exchange protocols</li>
<li>Methods using the public-key cryptosystem</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="public-key-cryptosystem" class="section level2">
<h2>Public-key cryptosystem</h2>
<p>Unlike the shared-key cryptosystem, the <strong>public-key
cryptosystem uses different keys for encryption and decryption</strong>.
The key used for encryption is called a “public key” and the key used
for decryption is called a “secret key”.</p>
<p>Compared to the shared-key cryptosystem, the public-key cryptosystem
tends to take more time for both encryption and decryption. Some
examples of methods for public-key encryption are RSA encryption and
elliptic curve cryptography.</p>
<p>If party A wants to send data to party B over the Internet, the
receiver (party B) creates a public and secret key. The public key is
sent to party A and used to encrypt the data. The ciphertext is sent to
party B and party B uses the secret key to decrypt the ciphertext from
party A.</p>
<p>Even if the public key and ciphertext are intercepted, it’s fine
because the ciphertext can only be decrypted with the secret key (not
that not transmitted). Therefore unlike the shared-key cryptosystem,
there is no key delivery problem with the public-key cryptosystem.</p>
<p>The public-key cryptosystem has another advantage of making it easy
to exchange information among an unspecified number of parties. For
example, if party B has prepared public and secret keys in advance and
shared the public key online. Multiple parties can use the public key to
encrypt data intended for party B. There is no need for multiple keys
for multiple parties.</p>
<p>However there are two problems with the public-key cryptosystem:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It takes time for both encryption and decryption and because of
this, it’s not suitable for exchanging small amounts of data back and
forth; the solution is to use a hybrid cryptosystem</li>
<li>Reliability of public keys; there is no way to show who created a
public key and a “person-in-the-middle attack” can occur</li>
</ol>
<p>The second problem is due to the fact that another party cannot
verify whether or not a public key was created by the a particular
person. To address this issue, a system of digital certificates is
used.</p>
</div>
<div id="hybrid-cryptosystem" class="section level2">
<h2>Hybrid cryptosystem</h2>
<p>The shared-key cryptosystem suffers from the key delivery problem,
where there’s a problem with securely exchanging keys. On the other
hand, the public-key cryptosystem suffers from slow processing during
encryption and decryption. The hybrid cryptosystem combines the two
systems to make up for each other’s faults; the shared-key cryptosystem
is used to quickly process data encryption and the keys used by the
shared-key cryptosystem are exchanged using the public-key
cryptosystem.</p>
<p>Let’s say party A wants to send data to party B over the Internet.
The data is encrypted using the faster shared-key cryptosystem. Since
party B needs the same key for decryption, party B creates public and
secret keys in advance, and the public key is used by party A to encrypt
the shared key. The shared key is sent to party B, along with the
encrypted data, and party B can decrypt the shared key using their
secret key and finally use it to decrypt the encrypted data.</p>
<p>The hybrid cryptosystem is used in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">SSL</a>.</p>

<h2>GnuPG concepts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#CONCEPTS">GnuPG</a>

<li>Symmetric ciphers</li>

</ul>
<div id="symmetric-ciphers" class="section level3">
<h3>Symmetric ciphers</h3>
<p>A symmetric cipher is a cipher that uses the same key for
<strong>both</strong> encryption and decryption. Two parties
communicating using a symmetric cipher must agree on the key beforehand.
Once they agree, the sender encrypts a message using the key, sends it
to the receiver, and the receiver decrypts the message using the
key.</p>
<p>As an example, the German Enigma is a symmetric cipher, and daily
keys were distributed as code books. Each day, a sending or receiving
radio operator would consult his copy of the code book to find the day’s
key. Radio traffic for that day was then encrypted and decrypted using
the day’s key. Modern examples of symmetric ciphers include 3DES,
Blowfish, and IDEA.</p>
<p>A good cipher puts all the security in the key and none in the
algorithm. In other words, it should be no help to an attacker if he
knows which cipher is being used. Only if he obtains the key would
knowledge of the algorithm be needed. The ciphers used in GnuPG have
this property.</p>
<p>Since all the security is in the key, then it is important that it be
very difficult to guess the key. In other words, the set of possible
keys, i.e., the key space, needs to be large. While at Los Alamos,
Richard Feynman was famous for his ability to crack safes. To encourage
the mystique he even carried around a set of tools including an old
stethoscope. In reality, he used a variety of tricks to reduce the
number of combinations he had to try to a small number and then simply
guessed until he found the right combination. In other words, he reduced
the size of the key space.</p>
<p>Britain used machines to guess keys during World War 2. The German
Enigma had a very large key space, but the British built specialized
computing engines, the Bombes, to mechanically try keys until the day’s
key was found. This meant that sometimes they found the day’s key within
hours of the new key’s use, but it also meant that on some days they
never did find the right key. The Bombes were not general-purpose
computers but were precursors to modern-day computers.</p>
<p>Today, computers can guess keys very quickly, and this is why key
size is important in modern cryptosystems. The cipher DES uses a 56-bit
key, which means that there are <span
class="math inline">\(2^{56}\)</span> possible keys
(72,057,594,037,927,936 keys). This is a lot of keys, but a
general-purpose computer can check the entire key space in a matter of
days. A specialized computer can check it in hours. On the other hand,
more recently designed ciphers such as 3DES, Blowfish, and IDEA all use
128-bit keys, which means there are <span
class="math inline">\(2^{128}\)</span> possible keys. This is many, many
more keys, and even if all the computers on the planet cooperated, it
could still take more time than the age of the universe to find the
key.</p>
</div>
<div id="public-key-ciphers" class="section level3">
<h3>Public-key ciphers</h3>
<p>The primary problem with symmetric ciphers is not their security but
with key exchange. Once the sender and receiver have exchanged keys,
that key can be used to securely communicate, but what secure
communication channel was used to communicate the key itself? In
particular, it would probably be much easier for an attacker to work to
intercept the key than it is to try all the keys in the key space.
Another problem is the number of keys needed. If there are <em>n</em>
people who need to communicate, then <em>n(n-1)/2</em> keys are needed
for each pair of people to communicate privately. This may be OK for a
small number of people but quickly becomes unwieldy for large groups of
people.</p>
<p>Public-key ciphers were invented to avoid the key-exchange problem
entirely. A public-key cipher uses a pair of keys for sending messages.
The two keys belong to the person receiving the message. One key is a
public key and may be given to anybody. The other key is a private key
and is kept secret by the owner. A sender encrypts a message using the
public key and once encrypted, only the private key may be used to
decrypt it.</p>
<p>This protocol solves the key-exchange problem inherent with symmetric
ciphers. There is no need for the sender and receiver to agree upon a
key. All that is required is that some time before secret communication
the sender gets a copy of the receiver’s public key. Furthermore, the
one public key can be used by anybody wishing to communicate with the
receiver. So only <em>n</em> keypairs are needed for <em>n</em> people
to communicate secretly with one another.</p>
<p>Public-key ciphers are based on one-way trapdoor functions. A one-way
function is a function that is easy to compute, but the inverse is hard
to compute. For example, it is easy to multiply two prime numbers
together to get a composite, but it is difficult to factor a composite
into its prime components. A one-way trapdoor function is similar, but
it has a trapdoor. That is, if some piece of information is known, it
becomes easy to compute the inverse. For example, if you have a number
made of two prime factors, then knowing one of the factors makes it easy
to compute the second. Given a public-key cipher based on prime
factorization, the public key contains a composite number made from two
large prime factors, and the encryption algorithm uses that composite to
encrypt the message. The algorithm to decrypt the message requires
knowing the prime factors, so decryption is easy if you have the private
key containing one of the factors but extremely difficult if you do not
have it.</p>
<p>As with good symmetric ciphers, with a good public-key cipher all of
the security rests with the key. Therefore, key size is a measure of the
system’s security, but one cannot compare the size of a symmetric cipher
key and a public-key cipher key as a measure of their relative security.
In a brute-force attack on a symmetric cipher with a key size of 80
bits, the attacker must enumerate up to <span
class="math inline">\(2^{80}\)</span> keys to find the right key. In a
brute-force attack on a public-key cipher with a key size of 512 bits,
the attacker must factor a composite number encoded in 512 bits (up to
155 decimal digits). The workload for the attacker is fundamentally
different depending on the cipher he is attacking. While 128 bits is
sufficient for symmetric ciphers, given today’s factoring technology
public keys with 1024 bits are recommended for most purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="hybrid-ciphers" class="section level3">
<h3>Hybrid ciphers</h3>
<p>Public-key ciphers are no panacea. Many symmetric ciphers are
stronger from a security standpoint, and public-key encryption and
decryption are more expensive than the corresponding operations in
symmetric systems. Public-key ciphers are nevertheless an effective tool
for distributing symmetric cipher keys, and that is how they are used in
hybrid cipher systems.</p>
<p>A hybrid cipher uses both a symmetric cipher and a public-key cipher.
It works by using a public-key cipher to share a key for the symmetric
cipher. The actual message being sent is then encrypted using the key
and sent to the recipient. Since symmetric key sharing is secure, the
symmetric key used is different for each message sent. Hence it is
sometimes called a session key.</p>
<p>Both PGP and GnuPG use hybrid ciphers. The session key, encrypted
using the public-key cipher, and the message being sent, encrypted with
the symmetric cipher, are automatically combined in one package. The
recipient uses his private-key to decrypt the session key and the
session key is then used to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>A hybrid cipher is no stronger than the public-key cipher or
symmetric cipher it uses, whichever is weaker. In PGP and GnuPG, the
public-key cipher is probably the weaker of the pair. Fortunately,
however, if an attacker could decrypt a session key it would only be
useful for reading the one message encrypted with that session key. The
attacker would have to start over and decrypt another session key in
order to read any other message.</p>
</div>
<div id="digital-signatures" class="section level3">
<h3>Digital signatures</h3>
<p>A hash function is a many-to-one function that maps its input to a
value in a finite set. Typically this set is a range of natural numbers.
A simple hash function is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span>
for all integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. A more
interesting hash function is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x mod
37\)</span>, which maps <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the
remainder of dividing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by 37.</p>
<p>A document’s digital signature is the result of applying a hash
function to the document. To be useful, however, the hash function needs
to satisfy two important properties. First, it should be hard to find
two documents that hash to the same value. Second, given a hash value it
should be hard to recover the document that produced that value.</p>
<p>Some public-key ciphers could be used to sign documents. The signer
encrypts the document with his private key. Anybody wishing to check the
signature and see the document simply uses the signer’s public key to
decrypt the document. This algorithm does satisfy the two properties
needed from a good hash function, but in practice, this algorithm is too
slow to be useful.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use hash functions designed to satisfy these two
important properties. SHA and MD5 are examples of such algorithms. Using
such an algorithm, a document is signed by hashing it, and the hash
value is the signature. Another person can check the signature by also
hashing their copy of the document and comparing the hash value they get
with the hash value of the original document. If they match, it is
almost certain that the documents are identical.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem now is using a hash function for digital
signatures without permitting an attacker to interfere with signature
checking. If the document and signature are sent unencrypted, an
attacker could modify the document and generate a corresponding
signature without the recipient’s knowledge. If only the document is
encrypted, an attacker could tamper with the signature and cause a
signature check to fail. A third option is to use a hybrid public-key
encryption to encrypt both the signature and document. The signer uses
his private key, and anybody can use his public key to check the
signature and document. This sounds good but is actually nonsense. If
this algorithm truly secured the document it would also secure it from
tampering and there would be no need for the signature. The more serious
problem, however, is that this does not protect either the signature or
document from tampering. With this algorithm, only the session key for
the symmetric cipher is encrypted using the signer’s private key.
Anybody can use the public key to recover the session key. Therefore, it
is straightforward for an attacker to recover the session key and use it
to encrypt substitute documents and signatures to send to others in the
sender’s name.</p>
<p>An algorithm that does work is to use a public key algorithm to
encrypt only the signature. In particular, the hash value is encrypted
using the signer’s private key, and anybody can check the signature
using the public key. The signed document can be sent using any other
encryption algorithm including none if it is a public document. If the
document is modified the signature check will fail, but this is
precisely what the signature check is supposed to catch. The Digital
Signature Standard (DSA) is a public key signature algorithm that works
as just described. DSA is the primary signing algorithm used in
GnuPG.</p>
